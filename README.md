#Motivation

I have been bartending for the last three years at a Craft beer bar. I've come to realise that people have very unique tastes in beer, however, they rarely can name their style preferences passed 'lager' and 'ale'. This recommender system aims to make beer selection easier for beer drinkers. 

#Recommender Systems

It's hard to surf the web these days and not come in contact with a recommender system. Amazon, YouTube, and Netflix are just a few of the online services that attempt to make your life  easier (and make a few extra bucks) by suggesting things you may like, based on your explicit feedback, and increasingly more so, on your implicit feedback.

Three types of Recommender Systems:

1. Content Based. Broadly speaking, this system is based on the premise that if you like one item, you will like another similar item. In terms of beer, if you like Guinness, you will most likely also like stouts, especially with a creamer.

2. Collaborative Based. This system focuses on the relationship between users and items. Strictly speaking, similar people like similar items. If person A and B, like Corona, Coors Light, and Heineken, and person A loves Sawdust City Little Norway, a Collaborative Based recommender system would recommend Little Norway to person B.

3. Hybrid Systems. This system combines Content and Collaborative systems. For example, if person C likes imperial stouts and IPAs. And person D also likes imperial stouts, but hates IPAs, a hybrid system would recommend other imperial stouts that person C liked to person D.
